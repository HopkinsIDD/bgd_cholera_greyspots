# Steps for running greyspots analysis

1. Assign sentinels according to different strategies with `assign_sentinels.R`. This is lightweight and can be run on a laptop. This script generates sentinelSamples... CSVs which list all sentinel sample groups from a given strategy.

2. Calculate total infections and population in each risk category for each bootstrap using `bang_in_boots.R` 

3. Analyze different strategies with `analyze_strategy.R`. This takes a long time and should be run on a cluster. This script generates survZoneBootData... CSVs and outputTable... RData, which are the primary results of these analyses.


# Notes

Key columns in all-boots.rds
* grid_id
* sample_rate: sampled infection rate
* sample_rr: sampled relative risk
* sample_total: sampled total infections
